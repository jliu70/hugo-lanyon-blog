## About me

Sometimes people have an "About me" section on the homepage of their website.

  It might even include a picture:

Hi! I hope you are finding this example blog helpful and enjoyable.


You can contact me like this: `SELECT REVERSE( 'moc.elpmaxe@ffej');`

I also invite you to connect with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/xyz) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/xyz).

This is really just a barebones website to stand as a template for creating a blog that is statically generated by [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com).

I am using a slightly modified version of the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com") Jekyll theme. I think it is very simple, clean, and elegant.
