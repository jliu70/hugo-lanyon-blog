[GitHub Pages][link-1] is a great way to have a website hosted directly from your GitHub repository.  You get one site per GitHub account and organization, and unlimited project sites.

For the user or organization, the website is hosted at `http://username.github.io`

For a project site, the URL is `http://username.github.io/projectRepository`

There are options to allow you to set up a custom domain with GitHub Pages.

GitHub provides step-by-step directions on how to set everything up at https://pages.github.com.

### Pricing
GitHub provides a free tier  (no private repositories - public repos only).  This can be a very inexpensive way for you to host a static website.

See https://github.com/pricing for more information.
